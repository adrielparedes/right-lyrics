Freezin' rests his head on a pillow made of concrete again ooh yeah
Oh feelin' maybe he'll see a little betters any days ooh yeah
Oh hand out faces that he sees come again ain't that familiar
Oh dark grin he can't help when he's happy he looks insane

Even flow
Thoughts arrive like butterflies
Oh he don't know, so he chases them away
Someday yet he'll begin his life again
Life again, life again

Kneelin' looking through the paper though he doesn't know to read, ooh yeah
Oh, prayin', now to something that has never showed him anything
Oh, feelin', understands the weather or that winters on its way
Oh, ceilings, few and far between all the legal halls of shame, yeah

Even flow
Thoughts arrive like butterflies
Oh, he don't know, so he chases them away

Someday yet he'll begin his life again
Oh whispering hands, gently lead him away
Him away, him away
Yeah
Woo
Oh yeah yeah fuck it up

Even flow
Thoughts arrive like butterflies
Oh, he don't know, so he chases them away

Someday yet he'll begin his life again
Oh whispering hands, gently lead him away
Him away, him away
Yeah!
Woo
Uh huh yeah
Yeah yeah mommy, mommy
